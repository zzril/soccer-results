soccer-results
==============

Prints all scores from current day of play in the German soccer bundesliga to the terminal, using [OpenLigaDB](https://www.openligadb.de/).

Usage:  
* `./bundesliga.py`: print all games
* `./bundesliga.py -h`: print help message
* `./bundesliga.py --team TEAM`: filter by team name TEAM

Future additions may include other leagues, colored output, and possibly turning this into some kind of self-updating terminal-application.
